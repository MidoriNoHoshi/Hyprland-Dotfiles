# Hyprland-Dotfiles

My current dotfiles 19.02.2025 for arch linux.
Waybar configuration is heavily inspired by vDawgGolden's waybar. . . The Workspaces module is basically identical.

GRUB bakeneko pixelart is by @nico_n_art. Crest in top left corner and on nvim dashboard: 大阪天満宮 家紋

## GRUB Configuration

What's included in this repository is just my custom theme that was located in /boot/grub/themes/ and the fonts used.
After installing these dotfiles, run the following command to generate the 'grub.cfg' file.

```bash
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg #Or whatever the appropriate command for your distribution is.
```
